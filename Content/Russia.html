                            <h3>1. Red Square</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5161747/shutterstock_1169764105-1-788x537.jpg">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    Originally intended to be a marketplace for the city, the name “Red Square” derives from the fact that the Russian word “krasnaya” means both “beautiful” and “red”. Red Square itself is more black than red, owing to its dark cobblestones and spans an area of approximately 74 metres squared.

                                    The exact date of the establishment of Red Square is unknown and probably goes back to at least the 15th century when it was the site of high profile public executions. The first recorded mention of Red Square by its current name dates back to the 17th century. The square’s history is also closely associated with that of the Kremlin, which borders it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Whilst Red Square was primarily a centre of trade throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, it was also considered a place of religious importance with several churches built around it and some ceremonies taking place on the square itself. It has also served a wider ceremonial and social role, being the site of several coronations of Russian tsars.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Today, Red Square is a tourist hotspot and one of the first places visitors frequent on their travels around Russia. This is due in large part to the Red Square’s central location and impressive surroundings. It is bordered by several sites of historical importance, including Lenin’s Mausoleum, the State History Museum, St. Basil’s Cathedral and, of course, the Kremlin.

                            <h3>2. St Basil’s Cathedral</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5161749/St-Basils-Cathedral-1-788x537.jpg">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    St Basil’s Cathedral was originally constructed in 1555, under the orders of Tsar Ivan IV (also known as Ivan the Terrible). Ivan’s intention in building St Basil’s Cathedral was to celebrate his victory in the Russo-Kazan Wars, specifically the siege of Kazan and the cathedral’s name was derived from that of a Russian Orthodox saint called Vasily (Basil) the Blessed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There has been much dispute over who actually designed St Basil’s Cathedral, but one particularly gruesome legend says that, after they did so, Ivan arranged for the architect’s eyes to be removed so that they could not create anything to rival its beauty. This is almost certainly untrue, given records show that they were employed 25 years later to add an extra chapel. In fact, St Basil’s Cathedral was quite an innovation in Russian architecture. Nothing like it had existed before.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    St Basil’s remains an iconic building for a reason: its colourful riot of onion domes still excites even the most jaded traveller when they view it for the first time. The cathedral is open year round, although with seasonal hours, and the maze of chapels inside can be confusing, especially when it’s busy. Whilst the interior is interesting, it’s the exterior which is the most impressive aspect of the cathedral. It can be bitterly cold inside in the winter!

                                    Stalingrad Battlefield was the site of one of the most important and bloodiest battles of the Second World War. The Battle of Stalingrad, which took place from July 1942 and February 1943, was the most important of the standoffs between Germany and the USSR and is commonly thought of as the turning point in the war.

                                <p>
                                    Those wanting to see Stalingrad Battlefield today can view remnants of the clash throughout Volgograd, from destroyed buildings to museums about the battle. The most prominent memorial showing Stalingrad Battlefield is the Mamayev Kurgan statue and complex.
