                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5165482/Osaka-Castle-788x537.jpg">

                                <p>
                                    The construction of the castle started in 1583 on the former site of the Ishiyama Honganji Temple, which had been destroyed thirteen years earlier. As the largest castle in Japan at the time, the general Hideyoshi Toyotomi intended for Osaka Castle to become the centre of a new, unified Japan. Obsessed with gold, Toyotomi insisted that gold be applied to much of the interior, while the motif appears on many of the exterior awnings to this day.

                                <p>
                                    However, a few years after Hideyoshi’s death, the castle was attacked and destroyed by Tokugawa’s troops. It was rebuilt in the 1620s, but its main castle tower was struck by lightening in 1665 and burnt down.

                                    It wasn’t until 1931 that the present reconstruction of the tower was built. Incredibly, it survived air raids during the war. In 1997, the castle underwent major repairs, and it is now an incredibly popular attraction.

                                <p>
                                    Today, the castle is five stories high and is a hugely popular site and historical museum. On each floor of the castle are a wide variety of artefacts detailing the extensive history of Osaka and the castle itself. Make sure to visit the top floor for a view of the city, as well as the beautiful surrounding park which is full of cherry trees, and even offers boat rides along the moat.

                            <h3>2. Hiroshima Peace Memorial</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5161754/Hiroshima-Dome-1-788x537.jpg">

                                    On 6 August 1945, US forces dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. It was the first ever use of the ‘A-bomb’. At the time, Japan was still at war with Allied forces in World War II and US President Harry S. Truman hoped that this action would cause the Japanese to surrender. In fact, Japan would surrender on 15 August 1945, but not before a further such bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki on 9 August.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The atomic bomb at Hiroshima instantly killed around 100,000 people and would go on to kill many thousands more as a result of radiation poisoning (approx 214,000 total with Nagasaki). It also devastated the city. The destruction was so great that the Hiroshima Peace Memorial building was the only structure which remained, thanks to its predominantly concrete and brick outer wall: everyone sheltering within was killed instantly however. The building’s survival is remarkable nonetheless, given it stands around 500ft from the centre of the powerful explosion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The dome itself has no public access: it can be viewed from anywhere in the Peace Park and remains an incredibly moving and powerful symbol of the destruction that occurred here.

                            <h3>3. Todai-ji</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5154789/shutterstock_407900689-1-788x537.jpg">

                                <p>
                                    Located in the capital Nara, the main buildings of the Todai-ji temple complex were constructed between 745 and 752 BC under Emperor Shōmu, a devout Buddhist, marking the adoption of Buddhism as state religion. At the time, Japan had experienced a series of disasters, including crop failures, a smallpox outbreak and an alleged coup, all seen as a lack of piety.

                                    Shōmu needed to unite Japanese clans under his centralised rule. Therefore, a 743 BC law stated that the people should be directly involved in building temples, with over two million people contributing through food and labour to constructing the great hall at Todai-ji.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 741 BC, Shōmu ordered the founding of a monastery in every province, lavishing massive funds on existing temples and monasteries, depleting the imperial treasury.. The Todai-ji temple was erected as the central administrative temple, the original hall eighty-eight metres long and forty-eight metres high, housing a huge bronze image of Variocana, the universal Buddha. Shōmu dedicated the temple and bronze Buddha in 752, declaring himself slave of the Three Precious Things: Buddha, Buddhist law and the church.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Today, Todai-ji is home to many precious cultural treasures linked to the temple, whilst also remaining a place of Buddhist rituals such as the Shuni-e. You can walk around the main hall of the Daubutsu-den, reconstructed to half of its original size, and beyond into the central park of Nara, looking out onto the beautiful Wakakusayama hills.
