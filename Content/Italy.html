                            <h3>1. Paestum</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5150286/Paestum-788x537.jpg">

                                <p>
                                    Founded as a Greek colony in the 6th century BC, Paestum was originally known as Poseidonia, named for the Greek god Poseidon.

                                    It is estimated that Poseidonia would have become a flourishing town by 540. The area came under the domination of the Lucanians (an indigenous Italic people) sometime before 400 BC, after which its name was changed to Paestum.

                                    Alexander, the king of Epirus, defeated the Lucanians at Paestum about 332 BC. The city remained Lucanian until 273, when it came under Roman rule and a Latin colony was founded there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The locality was still prosperous during the early years of the Roman Empire however, the changing climate and political upheavals of the later Roman Empire saw Paestum begin to decline in the early medieval period and by the turn of the millennium, the site had been abandoned. It was not rediscovered until the 18th century.

                                    In July 1969 a farmer uncovered an ancient Lucanian tomb that contained Greek frescoes painted in the early classical style. Paestum’s archaeological museum contains these and other treasures from the site.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The archaeological site of Paestum is home to three of the world’s best-preserved ancient Greek temples. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and includes a museum crammed with millennia-old frescoes, ceramics and artefacts. Among these, there is the iconic Tomb of the Diver funerary fresco.

                                    Today, visitors to Paestum can still see the spectacular temples, the Temple of Hera, the Temple of Neptune and the Temple of Ceres (thought by some to be a temple of Athena). The temples of Neptune and Hera are located next to each other at the southern end of the site, while the smaller Temple of Ceres is at the northern end. You can walk up close to the temples, but they are roped off to prevent interior access.

                            <h3>2. Herculaneum</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5150584/Herculaneum-788x537.jpg">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    Like nearby Pompeii, Herculaneum was engulfed by the lava and mud which spewed from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD and, as a result, much of the town was preserved throughout the centuries.
    
                                    Although smaller than Pompeii, Herculaneum was wealthier and a popular seaside retreat for the Roman elite. Regular excavations of Herculaneum’s ruins began in 1738 and have continued intermittently ever since, with a shifted focus on preserving what has already been unearthed, rather than excavating what remains.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Herculaneum arguably withstood the natural disaster better than Pompeii since many of its upper floors are still intact. This, combined with the fact that Herculaneum’s ruins are less crowded and easier to walk through, makes it a great site to visit.

                                    The internal architecture and décor of many of the two-storey ‘domus’ houses is remarkably preserved, with features in wood and marble, decorations, jewellery, and even organic remains like food providing a unique view into the daily lives of the ancient population of Herculaneum.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even the streets of Herculaneum ruins are fascinating, displaying the high degree of planning employed by the Romans. Some of the most stunning sites at Herculaneum include the thermal spas and baths, the gymnasium, the House with the Mosaic Atrium, and the House of Neptune. Most famous of all is the Villa of the Papyri, which was one of the most luxurious houses in all of Herculaneum.

                                    More sobering sites to visit include the so-called ‘boat houses’, in which the skeletal remains of at least 300 people were discovered.

                            <h3>3. DELL’OVO CASTLE</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.historypage.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1200px-Castelo_do_Ovo1-1200x800.jpg">

                                <p>
                                    The castle stands on a small island located in front of Via Partenope in Naples, formerly called Megaride, whose left side, looking from the mainland, is the result of a sea filled with made in the early twentieth century, named Borgo Marinaro. Residences were built on the same. They were designed to house the fishermen of Saint Lucia, forced to leave their homes to allow the urban regeneration of that part of town.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    From the twelfth century the fortification of the islet began, Ruggiero the Norman, conquered Naples, used that castle as his royal palace. Initial fortifications were transformed and strengthened to accommodate the real family and the crown jewels. The fortress became known as the Castel dell’Ovo, according to a legend that claimed in the foundations of the castle was located an egg by the poet and magician Virgilio, and if the egg was broken, the castle would collapse together with the city of Naples.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Currently, the castle presents a main entrance after which there is a large vestibule, here a road begins on which there are some medieval battlements, after a sharp bend under the Torre di Normandia, leads to the top of the castle.

                                    On the right, Salvatore’s church is after the Torre di Normandia, it presents Byzantine and Baroque frescoes; on the left is located a building that houses the Stanza Gotica.
