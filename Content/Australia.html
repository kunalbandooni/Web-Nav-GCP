                                    The site upon which Fort Scratchley stands was originally an early coal mine and indeed one of the earliest such mines in Australia, being in operation from around 1801. The first defensive battery to be constructed here was an earthern battery named Fort Battlesticks, which was in place by 1828. However, the need for more robust coastal defence during the Crimean War led to the construction of far more permanent fortifications, including Fort Scratchley, from 1876 to 1886. The fort was named for the British officer who oversaw the build, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Scratchley.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over several decades the fort was upgraded and renovated several times, to ensure it was militarily viable. However, the fort would only open fire in aggression once, on the night of 7-8 June 1942, when the fort’s six-inch guns fired two salvoes at a Japanese submarine which had bombarded Newcastle. After the war the fort operated for several more years before being decommissioned in 1962 and closed ten years later, when the Australian army finally left the site. It now operates as a museum.

                                    Today visitors to Fort Scratchley can explore the history of this coastal fortification as well as taking in the spectacular views on offer from this commanding position. Visitors can explore at their own pace (pick up a self-guided leaflet on your way in) or join one of the guided tours which go deeper into the facility. It’s quite a labyrinth so a tour can be helpful!

                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5150559/Bennelong-Point-788x537.jpg">

                                    Bennelong Point is known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule. It was originally a small tidal island which was made up of rocks and a small beach. It is located on the tip of the eastern arm of Sydney Cove, and protrudes into Port Jackson (Sydney’s natural harbour). For a brief time in 1788, it was known as Cattle Point because it was used to confine cattle that had been brought from Cape Town by the First Fleet.

                                <p>
                                    The most significant and famous moment of the point’s history involves its namesake, an Aboriginal man from the Eora nation called Bennelong. He was employed as a cultural interlocutor by the British, and had a brick hut built for him on the point. From 1818, the island was connected to the mainland via rocky rubble to provide a basis for Fort Macquarie to be built there. The existence of this rubble was largely forgotten until the late 1950s when both were rediscovered during the excavations related to the construction of <b>Sydney Opera House</b>.

                                    Today the site has become famous for being the home of the Sydney Opera House, which was formally opened in 1973, and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. The construction of the well-known building has left little trace of the earlier incarnations of the point, including Bennelong’s Hut.

                            <h3>3. Port Arthur</h3>
                            <img src="https://cdn.getyourguide.com/img/location/5a0837b618e01.jpeg/98.jpg">

                                    Port Arthur is one of eleven Australian convict sites and is Tasmania’s premier tourist attraction. Built in the 1830s from a small timber station in south-eastern Tasmania, the Port Arthur complex was the site of a prison for British convicts. Called the ‘inescapable prison’ for its reputedly shark-infested surrounding waters, escape attempts were rare. On occasion, they were successful. Visitors will hear the stories of escaped convicts Martin Cash, who escaped in 1842, and George ‘Billy’ Hunt who attempted to flee dressed in a kangaroo hide.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The prison’s population dwindled and by the 1870s, the inmates that remained were too old, ill or insane to be of any use as an effective labour force and the prison closed its doors in 1877. The buildings eventually fell into decay but in the 1970s, the government funded the site’s preservation and today you can see over 30 buildings in 40 hectares of landscaped grounds. In 1996, the site also saw a massacre by a lone gunman: over 35 people were killed and 23 more injured.

                                <p>
                                    The site is open daily for visitors: admission covers a 40 minute tour and 25 minute harbour tour, and it’s worth walking around the extensive grounds too. For fans of the macabre, night-time ghost tours are a spooky highlight, and for an additional cost, you can also see the 1,646 graves on the Isle of the Dead where everyone who died in prison was buried and you can take a trip to Point Puer Boys Prison where close to three thousand 9-16 year-old boys were disciplined in the sternest possible ways.
