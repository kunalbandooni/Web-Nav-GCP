                                    Borobudur Temple, the largest Buddhist monument in the whole world, will stun you with its captivating design and enchanting scenery. The appealing aesthetics and natural surroundings make it one of the beautiful temples in Indonesia and also one of the wonders of the world. While it is already an important religious site for Buddhists, it has not failed to gain the attention of the tourists.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The period in which the Javanese constructed Borobudur is shrouded in legend and mystery. No records pertaining to its construction or purpose exist, and dating the temple is based on artistic comparisons of reliefs and inscriptions found in Indonesia and elsewhere throughout Southeast Asia. Strong cultural and religious influenced arrived in what is now present-day Indonesia from the Indian subcontinent beginning around the 1st century CE. This influence grew rapidly from c. 400 CE onwards. Hindu and Buddhist merchants and traders settled in the region, intermarried with the local population, and facilitated long-distance trading relations between the indigenous Javanese and ancient India. Over the centuries, the Javanese blended the culture and religions of ancient India with their own.

                                <p>
                                    The long, uneven stairs of the temple not only take you through a physical journey but also guide you on a spiritual journey. Meandering inside the temple complex will make you feel like you are in the presence of God.

                            <h3>2. Prambanan Temple</h3>
                            <img src="https://a.travel-assets.com/findyours-php/viewfinder/images/res70/210000/210304-Prambanan-Temple.jpg">

                                    The Prambanan temple is the largest Hindu temple of ancient Java, and the first building was completed in the mid-9th century. Prambanan is located some 17 km (11 miles) northeast of the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, near the border between the two provinces of Yogyakarta and Central Java, on the island of Java. The ruins themselves lie 0.5 km south of the village of Prambanan.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Prambanan's abandonment mirrors that of nearby Borobudur. As the center of political power shifted from central to eastern Java under the reign of King Mpu Sindok (fl. 928 CE), Prambanan became less important politically and culturally to the ancient Javanese. The Sanjaya dynasty had successfully usurped power from the Sailendra dynasty, leaving the island of Java under their near complete suzerainty. Volcanic eruptions from Mount Merapi in the 10th century CE and countless earthquakes may have impacted Prambanan's appeal as a place of worship and pilgrimage as well among the Hindu faithful.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 1953 CE, the Temple of Shiva was reconsecrated to Hindu believers, and Prambanan was restored once again following the 2006 CE Yogyakarta earthquake. Intermittent archaeological excavation and restoration continue in and around Prambanan today.

                            <h3>3. Menara Kudus Mosque</h3>
                            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/e5/2d/7ee52d22aa6ec36b9583b03f75f5e4a6.jpg">
                            <div>

                                    The Menara Kudus Mosque or Al-Manar Mosque is located in Kudus in the Indonesian province of Central Java. Dating from 1549, it is one of the oldest mosques in Indonesia, built at the time of Islam's spread through Java. The mosque preserves the tomb of Sunan Kudus, one of the nine Islamic saints of Java (the Wali Sanga), and it is a popular pilgrimage point.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     It preserves pre-Islamic architectural forms such as old Javanese split doorways, ancient Hindu-Buddhist influenced Majapahit-style red brickwork, and a three-tired pyramidal roof. The most unusual feature is the brick minaret on which a pavilion shelters a large skin drum (bedug) which is used to summon the faithful to prayer instead of the more common muezzin. Whereas a bedug normally hangs under the eaves of a mosque veranda, in the Kudus Mosque it sits in a tower like a Balinese Hindu temple kul-kul or signal drum used to warn of impending attack, fire, or communal event. No other mosque in Java is known to have a drum tower of this type.
