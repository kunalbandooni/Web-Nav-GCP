                            <h3>1. Palace of Versailles</h3>
                            <img src="https://historiceuropeancastles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC04069-2-min.jpg">

                                <p>
                                    The Palace of Versailles was originally the hunting lodge of France’s King Louis XIII, but was transformed into a magnificent residence by his son and successor, Louis XIV.

                                    The ostentatious monarch built the Grand Apartment of the King and Queen which included the magnificent Hall of Mirrors before moving both his court and the government of France to Versailles in 1682. And so it remained until the French Revolution in 1789. As a symbol of the monarchical power and authority, the Palace was right at the epicentre of the Revolution.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On 5 October 1789, a procession of women, accompanied by a few men, travelled to Versailles. At this time, the king was hunting at Meudon, while Marie-Antoinette was walking on the Trianon estate. News of the march spread quickly through the town, and the gates of the Palace were shut. The queen, having been alerted, returned to her apartments and the king returned to the Palace. He received a delegation of women, to whom he made many promises.

                                    The women were soon joined by representatives of the rioters, which compromised the safety of the royal family. In the Royal Courtyard, in front of the Palace, the crowd cried “To Paris! To Paris!” The reunited royal family left Versailles on 6 October 1789.

                                <p>
                                    Since 1995, it has been run as a public establishment, with an independent administration and management supervised by the French Ministry of Culture.There are numerous places to visit at the Palace of Versailles and a range of tour options. Audio headsets are available as are guided tours. When visiting the Palace of Versailles, you can also see Marie Antoinette’s estate and The Grande Trianon.

                            <img src="https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/501/606/329/castle-of-carcassonne-green-trees-wallpaper-preview.jpg">

                                <p>
                                    Carcassonne is believed to have first been a hill fort known as an “oppidum” created in the sixth century BC and which formed a vital link between Europe as a whole and the Iberian Peninsula.

                                    In the first century BC, Carcassonne and the area in which it was located were incorporated into the Roman Empire and, in the third and fourth centuries, the town began taking shape with the construction of a mighty wall. This, now largely ruined, wall is still visible in Carcassonne today.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the Visigoth era, Carcassonne was a powerful stronghold, leading to a series of construction campaigns. However, it was from the twelfth century onwards that the structure of Carcassonne really took hold, initially with the building of the Count’s Castle or “Chateau Comtal”. The medieval fortifications seen today were built in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.

                                    Throughout its history, Carcassonne has been considered untouchable. Even before its walls were built it was the subject of two failed sieges in the thirteenth century and, during the Hundred Years’ War, an attack was never even attempted.
                                    <br>
                                    It was only in the nineteenth century that Carcassonne began to suffer deterioration was it was exploited for materials. The Carcassonne seen today was reconstructed by Violett-le-Duc.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is much to see at Carcassonne, including its incredible double fortified 3 km walls and 52 towers. There are audio guided tours of the majestic citadel and visitors can explore the cathedral, both built by the then ruling Trencavels.

                                    Tourists are also advised to visit the town’s central square, dominated by a large water fountain. There are several restaurants and outdoor cafés here. Alternatively, one can visit the various wine tasting spots scattered all around Carcassonne, whether that be the Minervois to the north, or the rugged Corbières to the south.

                            <h3>3. Nimes Arena</h3>
                            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Arenes_de_Nimes_Alt_1.jpg">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    Built during the reign of the Emperor Augustus in the 1st century, Nimes Arena was a marvel of Roman engineering with its stunning façade of archways and ornamentation. A vast oval amphitheatre reminiscent of the Colosseum, Nimes Arena could seat up to 24,000 people in its 34 terraces.

                                    The citizens of Nimes – then called Nemausus – would sit according to their social status and watch the games played there, ranging from animal hunts involving lions, tigers, and even elephants to the famous gladiatorial matches. Executions would also take place at the Arena, with those condemned to death being thrown to the animals.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the 6th century Nimes Arena began to play a military role under the Visigoths. Transformed from a sports arena to a castle fortress or “castrum arena”, it acted as an emergency shelter for the town’s inhabitants in the event of attack, and featured a large moat to help keep enemy forces out.

                                    Nimes Arena would go on to play an even more elaborate role in the 12th century when it became the seat of the Viscount of Nimes and home to a chateau, and soon a small residential neighbourhood had grown up inside its walls. In the 18th century, around 150 houses remained inside Nimes Arena, which in 1786 were demolished to revert the site to its original Roman grandeur.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now fully restored, Nimes Arena is a popular tourist attraction and allows visitors a glimpse into the dramatic world of the Roman amphitheatre. Including an interactive audio guide and detailed exhibits, the site is not only a marvel but is also highly informative and perfect for fans of ancient history.
                                </p>
