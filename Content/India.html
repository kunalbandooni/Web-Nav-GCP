                                    The Cellular Jail situated at the Atlanta point in Port Blair, capital of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is one of the spots in India that have a lot of historical background in the context of the British rule. 

                                    The jail surrounded by kaala paani (black waters) hides the darkest secrets of torture, atrocities and hardships faced by the political prisoners during the time of British Raj. It is now a national memorial museum that is one of the most visited tourist spots in Port Blair. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Wrapping the agony, anger and pain of inmates behind the excellent architecture, this jail which earlier was the centre for life imprisonment is now looked upon with patriotic fervour by the Indian visitors. The heart breaking stories are somehow still alive in these wings. This national memorial still stands strong to sing to the melodies of freedom which we enjoy now without even realising the cost at which we got it in the first place. Our Indian activists and freedom fighters like Batuskheswar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar were held captive in here during India’s freedom struggle.

                                    Located around 4 kms from the Vir Savarkar airport this monument should be at the top of your checklist as it marks the whole archipelago as the torturous deserted islands where the prisoners once brought to could never see the face of the main Indian subcontinent. 

                                    The museum and the light and show at the Cellular jail make the visitors understand the painful past that this structure holds within itself.

                            <h3>2. Taj Mahal</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/fly-images/5153597/Taj-Mahal-view-788x537.jpg">

                                    Built between 1631 and 1654, the construction of the Taj Mahal was ordered by the ruling emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favourite wife, Empress Mumtaz Mahal.

                                    The Empress had died in 1631 whilst giving birth to the couple’s fourteenth child, Gauhara Begum and her jade and jasper adorned coffin was placed in the centre of the Taj Mahal, although her body and that of her husband (buried there later) are actually contained several floors below.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The white marble structure of the Taj Mahal, with its central dome flanked by arches and smaller domes as well as minarets is famed for its incredible symmetry and opulent design. Inside, the Taj Mahal is lavishly decorated with plant life imagery and Koranic calligraphy, each aspect of which is entirely individual. In fact, it is believed that approximately 20,000 workers toiled to create the Taj Mahal.
                                </p>

                                    Sunrise or sunset are also widely regarded as the best time to get photographs, as well as the most pleasant temperatures. There is little shade and it can be exhausting under the hot Indian sun. 

                                    The complex itself is huge, and takes several hours to explore fully. – don’t miss the adjoining mosque and museum on site too. The gardens are extremely peaceful: look out for the gardeners cutting the lawns by hand.

                            <img src="https://imgcld.yatra.com/ytimages/image/upload/v1436263306/Jallianwala_Bagh_3.jpg">

                                    The Jallianwala Bagh massacre marked a turning point in India’s struggle for Independence. A memorial was set up by the Government of India in 1951 at Jallianwala Bagh to commemorate the spirit of Indian revolutionaries and the people who lost their lives in the brutal massacre.

                                    It stands as a symbol of struggle and sacrifice and continues to instill patriotism amongst the youth. In March 2019, the Yaad-e-Jallian Museum was inaugurated showcasing an authentic account of the massacre.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On April 13, 1919, the public had gathered to celebrate Baisakhi. However, the British point of view, as seen from the documents present in the National Archives of India, indicates that it was a political gathering.

                                    Inspite of General Dyer’s orders prohibiting unlawful assembly, people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh, where two resolutions were to be discussed, one condemning the firing on April 10 and the other requesting the authorities to release their leaders.

                                    When the news reached him Brigadier-General Dyer, headed to the Bagh with his troops. He entered the Bagh, deployed his troops and ordered them to open fire without giving any warning. People rushed to the exits but Dyer directed his soldiers to fire at the exit.

                                    The firing continued for 10-15 minutes. 1650 rounds were fired. The firing ceased only after the ammunition had ran out. The total estimated figure of the dead as given by General Dyer and Mr Irving was 291. However, other reports including that of a committee headed by Madan Mohan Malviya put the figure of dead at over 500.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Eventually, due to the brave struggle and sacrifice of such freedom fighters, the British had to relinquish their rule over India on August 15, 1945, which they had dreamt of ruling for centuries to come. The remembrance of this inhumane part of history will ensure that our coming generations learn to stand up to injustice.
