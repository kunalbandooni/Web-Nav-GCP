                            <img src="https://sabrangindia.in/sites/default/files/inline-images/bamiyan-buddhas-mc-913_df0a493b9b4349d32cb120bdf354fa98.fit-760w.jpg">

                                    The Buddhas of Bamiyan were carved in the Bamyan valley, which is located along the Silk Road and was the caravan route connecting China and the Western world. The site was a flourishing center for religion, art, and philosophy, and monks living in the numerous Buddhist monasteries near the valley made the region a thriving Buddhist site prior to Islamic invasion in the 7th century. It was during this period, which ranged from the 3rd and 6th century CE, that the Buddhas of Bamiyan were carved and served as major landmarks of the religion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Buddhas of Bamiyan were a pair monumental statues carved into a cliff in Afghanistan’s Hazarajat territory during the 6th century CE. The statues depicted Gautam Buddha and were prominent archeological sites that displayed the largest ever figures of Buddha. The  two statues, which measured 115 and 174 feet tall, stood for hundreds of years until they were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The smaller and the larger statues were popularly known as "Shahmama" and "Solsol," respectively. The statues displayed classic Gandhara artwork on sandstone cliffs, and a finish layer was modeled from a mixture of mud and straw and then coated with rare stucco to enhance the features of the hands, folds of the robe, and face. Although nothing is known about the sculptors and who commissioned the statues, the highlight the strong existence of Buddhism.

                            <img src="https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/9c35dfaa78fc6b3809f701014697789c-herat-citadel.jpg?fit=crop&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&auto=format&ixlib=react-8.6.4">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    Towering over the Old City, the Herat Citadel has watched over Herat’s successes and setbacks with its imposing gaze for centuries. The oldest building in Herat, it is believed to stand on the foundations of a fort built by Alexander the Great. It has served as a seat of power, military garrison and prison since its construction until 2005, when the Afghan army presented it to the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism, opening its doors to outsiders for the first time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     The Citadel is built on an artificial mound and stretches 250m east to west. Its 18 towers rise over 30m above street level, with walls 2m thick. A moat once completed the defences, although this was drained in 2003 to lay out a public park in the grounds. The present structure was largely built by Shah Rukh in 1415, after Timur trashed what little Genghis Khan had left standing. At this time, the exterior was covered with the monumental Kufic script of a poem proclaiming the castle’s grandeur, ‘never to be altered by the tremors of encircling time’. Sadly, most of this tiling has been lost bar a small section on the northwest wall, the so-called ‘Timurid Tower’. Time’s tremors inevitably did great damage to the Citadel. Repeated conquerors pillaged the Citadel, with locals prizing the valuable roof-beams and baked bricks. The greatest indignity came in 1953 when Herat’s army commander ordered its complete demolition in order to move his military base on the outskirts of the city. Only the direct intervention of King Zahir Shah halted the destruction. Subsequent neglect caused several sections to collapse.

                                    An extensive renovation programme was launched in the 1970s, completed just two months before the Soviet invasion. Visitors enter through the modern western entrance to the Citadel’s lower enclosure. Most of this section is currently closed, so you are instead led through an imposing wooden gate and atrium to the upper enclosure. This is the most heavily fortified part of the Citadel and has its own wells, which were used to allow defenders to withstand sieges. Archaeological excavations are still ongoing in the main courtyard. To the left, there is a small hammam with beautifully painted but damaged walls, showing flowers and peacocks. The biggest attraction is the Citadel’s huge curtain wall topped with battlements. These offer tremendous views over Herat, looking south towards Chahar Su, and north to the minarets of the Musalla Complex. It’s also possible to make out the last remains of the Old City walls. Leaving by the western gate there is a small museum, which had yet to open at the time of research.

                            <h3>3. Minaret of Jam</h3>
                            <img src="http://epic-curiousity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Minaret_of_jam_2009_ghor.jpg">

                                    The Minaret of Jam was built in the 12th century in Ghor province. This minaret is located next to the Hari River and, its height is 65 meters. In 2002, the UNESCO World Heritage Site announced that the Minaret of Jam was inscribed on the World Heritage List. Also, on December 10, 2020, it was registered as a cultural heritage of the Islamic world. Thus, the Minaret of Jam in Ghor is the second tallest historical monument. Archaeologists have always referred to it internationally as the oldest and most extraordinary brick minaret in the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The circular minaret rests on an octagonal base; it had 2 wooden balconies and was topped by a lantern. Its formal presentation has a striking similarity to the Ghazni minarets built by Masud III. It is thought to have been a direct inspiration for the Qutub Minar in Delhi, India.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Minaret of Jam belongs to a group of around 60 minarets and towers built between the 11th and the 13th centuries in Central Asia, Iran and Afghanistan, including the Kutlug Timur Minaret in Old Urgench (long considered the tallest of these still in existence). The minarets are thought to have been built as symbols of Islam's victory, while other towers were simply landmarks or watchtowers.
