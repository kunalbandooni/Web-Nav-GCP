                            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NsroHL08T4_0h1eL7QPpmw.jpeg">

                                    It acquired its iconic dedication to “the German People” in 1916 when the words ‘Dem Deutschen Volke’ were inscribed on its façade. The Reichstag was also the site where politician Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the institution of the German Weimar Republic in 1918. In 1933, a fire tore through the Reichstag, causing severe damage. The ruling National Socialist German Workers Party, the Nazis, blamed the fire on communist Marinus van der Lubbe, and used the incident as an excuse to suppress dissent.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Under Nazi dictatorship, the building fell into neglect. The Reichstag was heavily bombed during World War Two and emerged as a ruin, having become one of the primary targets for the Red Army in 1945 due to its perceived propaganda value. (Cyrillic graffiti left by Soviet soldiers in 1945 can be still seen).
                                    <br>
                                    Further neglect during the Cold War led to parts of the original Reichstag building, including its famous copula, being destroyed, though a partial renovation was undertaken in 1961 in the shadow of the newly erected Wall.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Reichstag was the venue of the German Reunification Ceremony on 3 October 1990, after which, architect Norman Foster restored the building. Since its completion in 1999, the Reichstag once again became the home of the new German national parliament – who convened there for the first time on 19 April 1999.

                                <p>
                                    Founded on 22 March 1933, a mere few weeks after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, Dachau Concentration Camp was seen as an example for the SS as to how to run other such camps throughout Europe. It was initially intended for political prisoners, and did so until roughly 1938, when the camp expanded rapidly in size following Kristallnacht (the Night of Broken Glass) and became a camp for prisoners – enemies of the Reich – in all forms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Overall, Dachau Concentration Camp is believed to have housed over 200,000 prisoners, which included Jews, homosexuals, communists and other groups considered to be inferior or subversive by the National Socialists. These prisoners were kept in dire conditions and subjected to ongoing atrocities including forced labour and medical experimentation. The camp was badly hit by typhus in 1944 and 1945, further weakening the already fragile inmates and killing approximately 15,000. In total, around 41,500 people were murdered at Dachau, many of whom were incinerated in the crematorium in Barrack X.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Today, the site of Dachau Concentration Camp houses a memorial to those who suffered and perished under the Nazis: expect to spend at least half a day here to take everything in and digest it. It’s not really suitable for children or some young teenagers – use your discretion and remember it’s a site of peace and remembrance today.
                                    <br>
                                    Visitors can tour the grounds and the remains of the camp, either self-guided, with audio guides (small extra cost) or as part of a 2.5 hour guided tour: these run at 11am and 1pm, with an additional slot at 12:15pm in the summer months.

                            <h3>3. Holstentor</h3>
                            <img src="https://d2g3wuzs461vml.cloudfront.net/1200x720/2c1ea0b7776aa3cf99fc5091cad13e63/holstentor.jpg">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    In medieval times, Lübeck was one of the member-cities of the Hanseatic League, an important merchant bloc which dominated trade in the North and Baltic Seas. This status meant the rich city of Lübeck felt the need to protect themselves with strong fortifications.

                                    What remains of the middle of increasingly strengthened gates is now known as Holstentor. The history of Holstentor is therefore that of 4 consecutive gates. In the 15th century, the entire gate construction was felt inadequate. Guns and canons had made the earlier fortifications seem useless, so funding was found and the city’s architect, Hinrich Helmstede, began construction in 1464.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Completed in 1478, the Holstentor was built on top of a hill raised to 7 metres. However, the south tower soon began to sag in the marshy ground. As a result, in the early 19th century the outer and inner gates were removed, leaving only the Middle Holsten Gate.

                                    Lübeck’s citizenry petitioned to keep the final gate at a time when there was every-growing resistance to destroying old buildings and by the time the gate was restored in 1871, Holstentor was seen as as a symbol of a proud past. Unfortunately, this belief was shared by the Nazis, who turned Holstentor into a museum called ‘The Hall of Honor and Glory’ according to their ideology.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Today, the Nazi museum is long gone. Visitors approaching Holstentor will notice from the field-side there are few windows – incase of attack – underneath the imposing twin towers. Those approaching from the city-side are faced with a more intricately designed and windowed wall.

                                    Inside, the museum now hosts an exhibition called ‘The Power of Trade’, tracing Lubeck’s Hanseatic history in Northern Europe. You can view the museum between 11am and 5pm each day of the week.
                                </p>
